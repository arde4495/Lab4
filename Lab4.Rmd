```{r , include =FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
babies <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ervance1/Sp2018-Data-Science-repo/master/babies2a.dat")
babies <- rename(babies, bwtoz = `bwt/oz`)

```{r, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data = babies, mapping = aes(x = bwtoz)) +
  
  geom_density(size = 1) +
  facet_grid(. ~ Premature)

```

* I used geom_density to show the distribution of birht wieght in ounces. I used facet command to show differences in the distribution based on whether or not the baby was premature. ( 1 is born before gestational age of 270, 0 is after 270)

* The mean of the distribution for birth weight of premature babies (~100) is the smallest of the three distributions.
